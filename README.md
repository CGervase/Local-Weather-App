#Local Weather App

This is a web app that returns links to Wikipedia articles based on the user's input. Wikipedia's api is used to retrieve links to 10 articles that are related to the user's input. The app can be found [here] (s.codepen.io/CGervase/debug/XKLqXL).

*NOTE: The app is currently inoperable due to the deprecation of the geolocation feature on non-https sites. An alternative is being researched and will be implemented soon.*
