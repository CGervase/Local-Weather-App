#Local Weather App

This is a web app that displays the current weather of the user's location. The weather information is pulled from Weather Underground, using Google's geolocation feature to attain the user's current location. The app can be found [here] (s.codepen.io/CGervase/debug/oLRPOp).

*NOTE: The app is currently inoperable due to the deprecation of the geolocation feature on non-https sites. An alternative is being researched and will be implemented soon.*
